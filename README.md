# ImageCompressionAndEncryption
This project is done as part of the course "Image Processing". In this project we implemented an Image Compression and Encryption algorithm from the reserach paper "Novel Image Compression-encryption hybrid algorithm based on a key-controlled measurement matrix in compressive sensing" by Nanrun Zhou, Aidi Zhang, Fen Zheng, Lihua Gong.
