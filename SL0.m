function s=SL0(A, x, sigma_min, sigma_decrease_factor, mu_0, L, A_pinv, true_s)
%
% SL0(A, x, sigma_min, sigma_decrease_factor, mu_0, L, A_pinv, true_s)
%
%   Returns the sparsest vector s which satisfies underdetermined system of
%   linear equations  A*s=x, using  Smoothed L0  (SL0) algorithm. Note that 
%   the matrix  A should  be a 'wide' matrix  (more columns than rows). The 
%   number of the rows of  matrix A  should  be  equal to the length of the 
%   column vector x.
%
%     The first 3 arguments should necessarily be provided by the user. The 
%   other parameters have defult values  calculated within the function, or
%   may be provided by the user.
%
%   Sequence of Sigma (sigma_min and sigma_decrease_factor):
%     This is a decreasing geometric sequence of positive numbers:
%       - The  first  element   of  the  sequence  of  sigma is  calculated 
%     automatically. The last  element  is  given  by  'sigma_min', and the 
%     change factor for decreasing sigma is given by 'sigma_decrease_factor'. 
%       - The default value of 'sigma_decrease_factor' is 0.5. Larger value 
%     gives better results  for less sparse sources, but it uses more steps 
%     on   sigma   to  reach  sigma_min,  and  hence  it  requires   higher 
%     computational cost.
%       - There is no default  value for  'sigma_min',  and  it  should  be 
%     provided  by  the  user (depending  on his/her estimated source noise 
%     level,  or  his/her  desired  accuracy).  By `noise' we mean here the
%     noise in the sources, that is, the energy of the inactive elements of
%     's'.   For example,  by  the  noiseless  case,  we  mean the inactive
%     elements of 's' are exactly equal to zero. As a rule of tumb, for the
%     noisy case,  sigma_min should be about 2 to 4  times  of the standard
%     deviation of this noise.  For the noiseless case, smaller 'sigma_min'
%     results in  better estimation of the sparsest solution, and hence its
%     value is determined by the desired accuracy.
% 
%   mu_0: 
%        The  value  of  mu_0  scales  the sequence of mu. For each vlue of 
%     sigma, the value of  mu is chosen via mu=mu_0*sigma^2. Note that this 
%     value effects Convergence.
%        The default value is mu_0=2 (see the paper).
%
%   L: 
%        number  of  iterations of the internal (steepest ascent) loop. The
%     default value is L=3.
%
%   A_pinv: 
%        is the  pseudo-inverse of matrix A defined by A_pinv=A'*inv(A*A'). 
%     If it is not provided, it will be calculated within the function.  If
%     you use this function for solving x(t)=A s(t) for different values of
%     't', it would be a good idea to calculate A_pinv outside the function
%     to prevent its re-calculation for each 't'.
%
%   true_s: 
%        is the  true value of the  sparse  solution.  This argument is for
%     simulation purposes. If it is provided by the user, then the function
%     will  calculate the SNR of the estimation for each value of sigma and
%     it provides a progress report.
